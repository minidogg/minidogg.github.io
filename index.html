            <h2>What I believe</h2>
            <p>I believe the web should be simpler and rely less on JavaScript on the front-end for everything when most cases they can just render on the server side.</p>
            <p>Speaking from experience slow and bloated sites can bog down low end machine including school computers that should have no reason to need state of the art CPUs, GPUs, etc</p>
            <p>I would happily like to announce this site doesn't require JavaScript to function and doesn't use a bloated framework. 
            Go ahead and try it. Install an extension to disable JavaScript, like uBlock Origin,
            or just disable it in your browser settings.</p>
